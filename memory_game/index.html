Bonus
It might be useful to add a "Reset" button to the HTML and set up an event in the JavaScript file so that the user can reset the game after playing.
For an extra challenge, consider how you could keep track of and display the user's score.

I also want to stop them when they've flipped two
and add the message on screen rather than as an alert
